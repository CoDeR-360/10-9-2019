			<p class = "text">Geez we've known each other for so, so long but I just really got to know you well last year and I think we
			really vibed well. There's so many people I know and I've met, but I've never gotten to know someone like you; you're smart, really nice,
			helpful, kind, pretty, and just all around amazing. Flashback to last year during scio, when we were working last minute on getting
			our mousetrap vehicle to just work, I loved working with you and just liked having someone I relied on to talk to and collaborate with. 
			I've liked you for the longest time ever, but I never just found the right place/time to tell you or say it. Honestly, the way it just
			clicked into my mind is really funny thinking about it, but it went like this. I got home from school one day, turned on my ps4, and
			started playing fortnite with Aryaan. Somehow our conversation ended up with us talking about who we liked, and it all just clicked; I 
			just said "Damn, Megan's awesome, I really like her". </p>
