I was assigned Goal 7 For My Quarter 1 Project. As a result, my Quarter 1 Project is a collection of pages about a non-profit
organization called En3rgy. En3rgy is committed to solving Goal 7, and attempts to do this by sending their volunteers to 
lower developed countries and try to help establish a more reliable energy source. Through this project, there are 5 pages,
a Homepage, an About Us Page, a Goal 7 Information page, an Interest form Page, and a Thank You page for the interest form.
